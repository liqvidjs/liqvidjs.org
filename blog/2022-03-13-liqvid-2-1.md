description: Liqvid 2.1 adds support for the Web Animations API in videos.

I'm very excited to announce the release of Liqvid 2.1. The major new feature is the ability to use the [Web Animations API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API/Using_the_Web_Animations_API) in videos, making animation in Liqvid dramatically easier. There are also dozens of little changes making Liqvid development smoother and easier overall.

## Animation

The [Web Animations API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API/Using_the_Web_Animations_API) makes animation on the web easier, faster, and declarative. Here's how to use it in Liqvid:

```tsx liqvid
// @css
h1 {
  font-family: "Comic Sans MS";
  font-size: 6rem;
  position: absolute;
  text-align: center;
  top: 20%;
  width: 100%;
}

.box {
  border-radius: .5em;
  height: 5em;
  position: absolute;
  width: 5em;
}

.blue {
  background-color: blue;
  left: calc(35% - 2.5em);
}

.green {
  background-color: green;
  left: calc(50% - 2.5em);
}

.purple {
  background-color: purple;
  left: calc(65% - 2.5em);
}
// @/css
// freeze-next-line
import {Playback, Player, Utils} from "liqvid";
const {easings} = Utils.animation;
const {combineRefs} = Utils.react;

const playback = new Playback({duration: 5000});

/* animations */
const fall = (delay: number, duration: number) => playback.newAnimation(
  [{top: "0%", transform: "rotate(0deg)"}, {top: "55%", transform: "rotate(360deg)"}],
  {delay, duration, easing: `cubic-bezier(${easings.easeOutSine})`, fill: "both"}
);

const fadeIn = (delay: number, duration: number) => playback.newAnimation(
  [{opacity: 0}, {opacity: 1}],
  {delay, duration, easing: "ease-in-out", fill: "both"}
);

const scale = (delay: number, duration: number) => playback.newAnimation(
  [{transform: "scale(1)"}, {transform: "scale(3)"}],
  {delay, duration, easing: "ease-in-out", fill: "both"}
);

function MyVideo() {
  return (
    <Player playback={playback}>
      <div className="box blue" ref={fall(0, 800)}/>
      <div className="box green" ref={fall(200, 800)}/>
      <div className="box purple" ref={fall(400, 800)}/>
      {/* we can use combineRefs to combine animations */}
      <h1 ref={combineRefs(fadeIn(2000, 700), scale(2000, 700))}>Wow</h1>
    </Player>
  );
}
ReactDOM.render(<MyVideo/>, document.querySelector("main"));
```

A big challenge here was mobile support: Liqvid aims to work even on very old browsers, since static videos work everywhere. Old versions of iOS (I personally use iOS 12) don't support the WAAPI; although a [polyfill](https://github.com/web-animations/web-animations-js) exists, it doesn't completely work, breaks the native Web Animations support in newer browsers, and is no longer maintained. Therefore, we have a [script](/docs/guide/mobile#web-animations) which loads the polyfill selectively and patches some of the issues with it.

### `useTime()`

The WAAPI covers most, but not all animation needs. For classical prop-updating animation, we have a new [`useTime()`](/docs/reference/hooks#useTime) hook. Besides a shorter name, this improves on the existing [`useTimeUpdate()`](/docs/reference/hooks#useTimeUpdate) in two ways:

* gets called once before video starts playing, so animations will initialize correctly

* accepts a "selector" function, similar to state libraries, avoiding unnecessary rerenders

See it in action on the [React Three Fiber](/docs/integrations/three) page (oh yeah, we added that too!)

## Ease-of-use

This update also contains lots of little changes making Liqvid easier and less awkward to use:

* it is no longer necessary to use the `Script` class, `<Player>` can be used with just a `Playback`

* the `start` prop on [`<Audio>`](/docs/reference/Audio) and [`<Video>`](/docs/reference/Video) now defaults to `0`, and can be omitted

* [`--lv-canvas-height`](/docs/reference/css) CSS variable can be used instead of `calc(100% - var(--lv-height))`

* we now provide the [fake fullscreen](/docs/guide/mobile#fake-fullscreen) code as an includable script

* the [`thumbs`](/docs/reference/Player#thumbs) prop takes reasonable defaults, so you only need to specify `path` and `highlights`

* [`Playback`](/docs/reference/Playback) and [`Script`](/docs/reference/Script) now inherit from [`EventEmitter`](https://nodejs.org/dist/v11.13.0/docs/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter), getting rid of the `hub` property

* [`Utils.animation.bezier()`](/docs/reference/Utils/animation#bezier) and [`Utils.animation.easings`](/docs/reference/Utils/animation#easings) have been added back in

* there is a new [`Utils.json`](/docs/reference/Utils/json) for loading recording data, and a new [`Utils.svg`](/docs/reference/Utils/svg) for making interactive SVG components

* we now ship a hybrid CJS/ESM package (**this was the worst**)

* the documentation and typings are much improved!

## A view to the future

Internally, the codebase has been massively restructured, with most of the code split off into separate packages under the [`@liqvid`](https://www.npmjs.com/org/liqvid) namespace. I'm intending Liqvid 3.0 to be Web Components based, and usable with other libraries like Vue in addition to React.

The somewhat awkward `onMouseUp={Player.preventCanvasClick}` escape hatch has been replaced with `data-affords="click"`. This allows extensions to be Liqvid compatible without having to import the library. My next big priority is cleaning up the various recording plugins and making them cross-compatible with GSAP, Remotion, and plain `<audio>` elements.

Other priorities for Liqvid 2.2 are a captions editor, better accessibility for non-sighted users, and internationalization.

Finally, with 2.1 out the door I'm hoping to get back to creating *content* with Liqvid. Be on the lookout for a Geometry and Graphics series!
