Close on the heels of ractive-player 2.0, we now have a site with documentation and tutorial! Hooray!

The launch of ractive-player.org is dedicated to my friend [Joel Adria](https://joeladria.com/). Joel and I have known each other since kindergarten; we started coding together as part of the Webmasters at Avalon Junior High, which is where I got my start in web development. Our most successful collaboration was the wildly popular Bearbook, a timetable-sharing Facebook app for University of Alberta students which in its heyday had [over 9,000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiMHTK15Pik) users. Today is Joel's 30th birthday. Happy birthday, Joel!
