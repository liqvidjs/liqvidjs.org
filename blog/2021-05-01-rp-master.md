I'm delighted to announce the <del>rp-master</del><ins>@liqvid/cli</ins> package, which brings two *very* exciting features: automatic rendering of traditional videos, and *much* easier thumbnail generation.

## Static video export {#static-video-export}

One of the downsides of ractives is that you can't upload them to YouTube/Twitter/etc. It's now easy to render your ractive to a traditional mp4/webm file:

```bash
liqvid render -a ./audio/audio.mp4 -u http://localhost:8080 -o out.mp4
```

You can then upload that to social media sites for discoverability, while providing a link to the interactive version on your own site. This feature is, of course, inspired by [Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev). Sometime soon I will launch a YouTube channel for the [Epiplexis](https://epiplexis.xyz) videos.

## Thumbnail generation {#thumbnail-generation}

Previously, generating thumbnail previews for the scrubber bar was a very convoluted process: you had to install a Chrome extension and configure it weirdly and activate it in an awkward way and not touch your computer for a few minutes while it did its thing. Now it's as easy as

```
liqvid thumbs -u http://localhost:8080
```
