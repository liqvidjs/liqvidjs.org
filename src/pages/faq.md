<dl class="qa">
  <dt>Do liquid videos work on mobile?</dt>
  <dd>There are some UX improvements to be made, but yes, liquid videos should be fully functional on mobile. Check the <a href="/docs/guide/mobile">Mobile section of the Guide</a> for tips on making sure your videos are mobile-friendly.</dd>

  <dt>Can liquid videos be uploaded to YouTube/Twitter/etc.?</dt>
  <dd>No, you will have to host them yourself. But you can easily <a href="/docs/cli/render">make an MP4 recording of a Liqvid project</a> and upload that to social media for discoverability, and then provide a link to the interactive version.</dd>
