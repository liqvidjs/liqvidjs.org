<dl class="qa">
  <dt>Where does the word "ractive" come from?</dt>
  <dd>It comes from Neal Stephenson's book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diamond_Age">The Diamond Age</a>. (Although the ractives in <i>The Diamond Age</i> are quite a bit more powerful than ours.)</dd>

  <dt>Do ractives work on mobile?</dt>
  <dd>There are some UX improvements to be made, but yes, ractives should be fully functional on mobile. Check the <a href="/docs/guide/mobile">Mobile section of the Guide</a> for tips on making sure your ractives are mobile-friendly.</dd>

  <dt>Can ractives be uploaded to YouTube/Twitter/etc.?</dt>
  <dd>No, you will have to host them yourself. But you can easily <a href="/docs/rp-master/render">make an MP4 recording of a ractive</a> and upload that to social media for discoverability, and then provide a link to the interactive version.</dd>

  <dt>Is this library related to <a href="https://ractive.js.org/" target="_blank">Ractive.js</a>?</dt>
