<!-- ## History -->

<!-- Knowing the history of this project may help to understand some of the design decisions. The idea of a medium synthesizing—and dissolving the difference between—video and interactive text, as well as the word *ractive*, came from reading Neal Stephenson's [The Diamond Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diamond_Age) in 2012/2013. (Though the ractives in The Diamond Age are much more powerful than this module is.)

At the time, I tried to build something like this using a lot of XML and XSLT, and later Custom Elements (React didn't exist yet, plus I used to really Believe in XML). The basic model was to record an ordinary video, then add Javascript events to fire at specific timepoints and control the video.
