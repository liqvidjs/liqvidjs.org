title: Packages
---

The core library only aims to provide a framework, much like React itself. Complex effects are provided in separate packages.

## Core packages {#core-packages}
- [ractive-player](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ractive-player)<br/>The core package.

- [rp-recording](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rp-recording)<br/>A system for recording audio and author actions.

- [rp-thumb-capture](https://github.com/ysulyma/rp-thumb-capture)<br/>Control and Chrome extension for generating [thumbnail previews](/docs/guide/mastering#thumbnails).

## Miscellaneous {#misc}

- [rp-cursor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rp-cursor)<br/>Record and replay cursor motion.

- [rp-paint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rp-paint)<br/>Record and replay stylus drawing. Warning: this package works well enough for basic writing purposes, but it is very buggy and many of the fancier features (colors, layers) do not work reliably yet.

- [rp-prompt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rp-prompt)<br/>Provides prompts to read from when recording.

## Coding

- [rp-codebooth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rp-codebooth)<br/>A GUI with Code/Playground/Copy/Run/Clear buttons and an Output pane. Based on `rp-codemirror`; use that directly if you want more customization.
